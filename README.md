# Personalized-News-Recommendation-System
Tired of being stuffed with information ?? I bring to you my very own personalized news recommendation system for your daily news.

Before the era of smartphones, I remember a time when I woke up every morning, sipping my cup of coffee and reading the newspaper, primarily THE HINDU newspaper. Earlier on I used to only read the sports section, especially cricket news. However, I realized later on the value of scanning all articles in a newspaper and reading articles that interest me. With the advent of smartphones and a busy lifestyle that followed, my family discontinued the purchase of newspapers and platforms like YouTube became my primary source of information. I was never a fan of reading on my mobile, so thereby, I lost the habit of reading a newspaper. 

While YouTube serves as a platform where information is in large volume and most importantly, FREE, I started relying a lot on YouTube for my daily dose of information. However, with time, I realized that I was no longer watching YouTube in the morning for my information but rather another source of entertainment. I remembered my mother's words echoijng through me about how watching TV in the morning would ruin my life and here I am watching a mini sized TV with unlimited content. 

Since living on my own, I realized that I wake up every morning and resort to my smartphone for entertainment and over time became dependent and addicted to it. To counter this problem, I believe we can use GenAI's powerful retrieval and generation abilities to get our morning newspapers back. Now you may ask me a very naive question, why not just buy back newspapers ? The simple, yet elegant response for that is, as humans, we are starved of content today and can no longer rely on just newspapers for our source of information. Instead, to instill people to get multiple sources of information that are reliable and also interesting, I believe this product will provide an interface along with proper citations for the same.

Tech Stack I'm planning to use

1. Perplexity's algorithm for information retrieval
2. React.JS + FastAPI for development
